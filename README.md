SeizureNet: Dynamic Graph Neural Networks for EEG-Based Seizure Detection
Project Overview
SeizureNet is a deep learning framework built to detect and classify epileptic seizures using EEG (Electroencephalography) signals. By modeling brain activity as a dynamic graph and applying Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), this system captures rich spatio-temporal, semantic, and taxonomic relationships between brain regions to enhance diagnostic accuracy.
This project is inspired by research in neuroinformatics and brain signal modeling, and aims to support early and accurate seizure prediction for healthcare applications.

Key Features
‚Ä¢	EEG Signal Processing: Converts raw EEG data into structured graph representations based on electrode spatial configurations.
‚Ä¢	Dynamic Graph Modeling: Captures time-series brain connectivity as evolving graphs to model both short-term and long-term patterns.
‚Ä¢	Graph Neural Network Architectures: Implements GCN, GAT, and other GNN variants to learn meaningful features from brain graphs.
‚Ä¢	Seizure Classification: Binary or multi-class seizure classification with high performance metrics.
‚Ä¢	Custom Visualization Tools: Includes visualization of EEG connectivity graphs and model predictions.



üì° Dataset
This project can be used with publicly available EEG datasets such as:
‚Ä¢	CHB-MIT Scalp EEG Database
‚Ä¢	Temple University Hospital (TUH) EEG Corpus
Data is preprocessed into segments and converted into graphs using spatial adjacency of EEG electrodes.

üîç Methodology
1.	EEG Preprocessing: Filter, normalize, and segment raw EEG signals.
2.	Graph Construction: Construct brain connectivity graphs using spatial and statistical correlations.
3.	Dynamic Graph Creation: Model EEG windows as sequences of graph snapshots.
4.	GNN Training: Train GNNs to classify seizure vs. non-seizure activity.
5.	Evaluation: Use metrics such as Accuracy, F1-Score, Precision, and Recall.
üìä Results

Model	Accuracy	F1 Score	AUC
GCN	87.3%	0.86	0.90
GAT	89.1%	0.88	0.92
GraphSAGE	88.6%	0.87	0.91

Performance depends on dataset and preprocessing pipeline.
